      "bio": "Jesus Christ is the central figure of Christianity, believed to be the Son of God and God in the flesh. Born in Bethlehem, he lived a sinless life and began his ministry around age 30, teaching about repentance, faith, and God’s kingdom. He performed miracles, healed the sick, and shared profound teachings through parables. Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate, a death Christians believe was a sacrifice for humanity’s sins, and rose from the dead three days later. His resurrection is seen as the foundation of Christian faith, and he is worshiped as Savior and Lord by billions worldwide today. "

He was martyred in Rome and is remembered as a missionary, theologian, and pillar of the early Church."
